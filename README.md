# Hi, I’m Gunnar 👋

I’m a developer who builds **AI automation tools** that work entirely on your local machine — no cloud required. My focus is creating agents that can see, understand, and control desktop software, turning messy workflows into simple repeatable processes.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring massive open worlds in **ARK: Survival Evolved**, **Minecraft**, or **No Man’s Sky** — and yes, I love building mods, automations, and tools for my favorite games.

## 🖥️ What I Build
- **Local-first AI agents** using Python, OpenCV, Tesseract, and PyAutoGUI  
- **Automation CLIs** in TypeScript and Node.js for repeatable, auditable workflows  
- **Optimization tools** for routing, logistics, and decision-making  
- **CS fundamentals** projects — algorithms with clear explanations and code

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Frameworks & Tools:** React Native, Node.js, Docker, GitHub Actions  
**Specialties:** Computer vision, OCR, automation, workflow design  

## 🎯 Featured Projects
- **win-vision-agent** — Local desktop agent that clicks and types by reading your screen  
- **ops-copilot** — Safe YAML-driven automation with human approvals  
- **logistics-route-optimizer** — Vehicle routing with OR Tools  
- **cs-algorithms-with-explanations** — Interview prep with human-readable write-ups  
- **ocr-ui-bench** — OCR benchmark for Windows UI text
